= Dependencies =

  Sun JDK 6
  Apache Ant 1.8


= Compile & Run =

  To run this program, you must pass in an input file.  Sample input files 
  are included in the data/ directory.

  ant run -Dinput=data/input-1

  Alternatively, to run the jar directly, you can use:
  
  ant jar
  java -jar build/jar/os1.jar data/input-1


= Run Tests =

  Tests are setup to run the Linker against all of the sample input files in
  data/ and compare the output with the sample output files in data/.

  The tests currently don't work, because of the output format of logs from
  the Linker (they show dates and times.)  This makes output comparison
  in test cases not possible.

  ant test
