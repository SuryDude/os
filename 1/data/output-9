The output above assumes that use list processing precedes relocation
(or that if relocation is done first, use list processing uses the
*non-relocated* address to find the next element in the chain).

It is also reasonable to first relocate R 2001 (the first word of the
middle module) to E 2002 *before* processing the use list.  This makes
the use chain an infinite list since we are pointing back to where we
started).  Hence different error msgs would result and are acceptable.
If you program works in such a manner, please explain it in your
README file.

This abmiguity illustrates the difficulties of writing unambiguous
specifications, especially when there are error cases involved.
