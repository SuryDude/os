= Dependencies =

  Sun JDK 6
  Apache Ant 1.8


= Compile & Run =

  To run this program, you must pass in an input file.  Sample input files 
  are included in the data/ directory.

  ant -Dtype=fcfs -Dinput=data/input-1

  To run this program in verbose mode, use the following command.
  WARNING: Verbose mode drastically slows down execution.

  ant -Dtype=fcfs -Dverbose=--verbose -Dinput=data/input-1

  Valid type values are: fcfs, hprn, rr2, uni

  Alternatively, to run the jar directly, you can use:
  
  ant jar
  java -jar build/jar/os1.jar fcfs --verbose data/input-1


= Run Tests =

  There are currently no tests, but if there were:

  Tests are setup to run the Linker against all of the sample input files in
  data/ and compare the output with the sample output files in data/.

  The tests currently don't work, because of the output format of logs from
  the Scheduler.   This makes output comparison in test cases not possible.

  ant test
