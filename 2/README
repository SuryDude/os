= Dependencies =

  Sun JDK 6
  Apache Ant 1.8


= Compile & Run =

  To run this program, you must pass in an input file.  Sample input files 
  are included in the data/ directory.

  ant -Dtype=fcfs -Dinput=data/input-1

  To run this program in verbose mode, use the following command.
  WARNING: Verbose mode drastically slows down execution.

  ant -Dtype=fcfs -Dverbose=--verbose -Dshow-random=--show-random -Dinput=data/input-1

  Valid type values are: fcfs, hprn, rr2, uni

  Alternatively, to run the jar directly, you can use:
  
  ant jar
  java -jar build/jar/os2.jar --type fcfs --verbose --show-random data/input-1


= Run Tests =

  Tests are setup to run each Scheduler against all of the sample input files
  in data/ and compare the output with the sample output files in data/.

  To run the tests, use:

  ant test

  There are also tests that compare verbose output, and verbose output with
  random numbers.  These tests have been moved into a separate ant target and
  JUnit suite because they don't quite match work, as the output differs very
  slightly.

  To run the verbose tests, use:
  
  ant test-verbose
