= Dependencies =

  Sun JDK 6
  Apache Ant 1.8


= Compile & Run =

  To run this program, you must pass in an input file.  Sample input files 
  are included in the data/ directory.

  ant -Dinput=data/input-01

  Alternatively, to run the jar directly, you can use:
  
  ant jar
  java -jar build/jar/os3.jar data/input-01

  As a convenience mechanism, there is all.sh, which:
    * Builds the JAR
    * Runs the JAR against all 13 input files in data/.

  To run it, use:

  ./all.sh
